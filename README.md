# DPDK Project: Setting Up and Running the helloworld Example

This repository contains the setup and execution of the **helloworld** example using the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) within a VPP (Vector Packet Processing) environment. This report outlines the steps, challenges faced, solutions applied, results achieved, and system specifications.

## Prerequisites

To replicate this project, the following tools and dependencies were installed:
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** (or compatible Linux distribution)
- **DPDK** (integrated within VPP source code)
- **Meson** (version 1.8.0 or higher)
- **Ninja** (version 1.10.0 or higher)
- **Dependencies**: `libnuma-dev`, `libpcap-dev`, `python3-pyelftools`, `ninja-build`, `python3-pip`

These were installed using:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libnuma-dev libpcap-dev python3-pyelftools ninja-build python3-pip

Steps to Set Up and Run helloworld
1. Configuring HugePages

HugePages were allocated to provide large, contiguous memory pages for DPDK. A total of 1024 HugePages (2 GB) were configured.

Command:
bash

sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=1024

Result: The system successfully allocated 1024 HugePages, verified using cat /proc/meminfo | grep HugePages.
2. Setting Up the DPDK Build Environment

The DPDK source code was located at /home/eagle/vpp/build-root/build-vpp-native/external/src-dpdk. The helloworld example was built using Meson and Ninja.

Commands:
bash

cd /home/eagle/vpp/build-root/build-vpp-native/external/src-dpdk
rm -rf build
meson setup build
cd build
meson configure -Dexamples=helloworld
ninja

Result: The build process created the dpdk-helloworld executable in build/examples/.
3. Running the helloworld Example

The helloworld example was executed on CPU cores 0-3 to verify the DPDK installation.

Command:
bash

sudo ./build/examples/dpdk-helloworld -l 0-3 -n 4

Result: The example ran successfully, printing "hello" from each core (0 to 3), confirming that DPDK was correctly configured and operational.
Challenges and Solutions
1. Outdated Meson Version

    Issue: The initial Meson version (0.53.2) was incompatible with DPDK, which required version 0.57 or higher.

    Solution: Upgraded Meson to version 1.8.0 using:
    bash

    pip3 install --user meson --upgrade
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

    Outcome: The upgraded Meson resolved compatibility issues.

2. Missing helloworld Executable

    Issue: After running ninja, the dpdk-helloworld executable was not found.

    Solution: Rebuilt the project from scratch:
    bash

    cd /home/eagle/vpp/build-root/build-vpp-native/external/src-dpdk
    rm -rf build
    meson setup build
    cd build
    meson configure -Dexamples=helloworld
    ninja

    Outcome: The executable was correctly generated.

3. PATH Configuration for Meson

    Issue: Upgraded Meson was not in the systemâ€™s PATH.

    Solution: Added ~/.local/bin to PATH (see commands above).

    Outcome: Correct Meson version (1.8.0) was used.

Conclusion

This project successfully configured HugePages and ran the DPDK helloworld example on CPU cores 0-3. The challenges related to Meson versioning and build issues were resolved through careful debugging and rebuilding. The results confirm that the DPDK environment is correctly set up.
