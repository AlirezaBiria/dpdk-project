## Prerequisites

To replicate this project, the following tools and dependencies were installed:
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** (or compatible Linux distribution)
- **DPDK** (integrated within VPP source code)
- **Meson** (version 1.8.0 or higher)
- **Ninja** (version 1.10.0 or higher)
- **Dependencies**: `libnuma-dev`, `libpcap-dev`, `python3-pyelftools`, `ninja-build`, `python3-pip`

These were installed using:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libnuma-dev libpcap-dev python3-pyelftools ninja-build python3-pip

Steps to Set Up and Run helloworld
1. Configuring HugePages

HugePages were allocated to provide large, contiguous memory pages for DPDK. A total of 1024 HugePages (2 GB) were configured.

Command:
bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=1024

Result: The system successfully allocated 1024 HugePages, verified using cat /proc/meminfo | grep HugePages.

2. Setting Up the DPDK Build Environment

The DPDK source code was located at /home/eagle/vpp/build-root/build-vpp-native/external/src-dpdk. The helloworld example was built using Meson and Ninja.

Commands:
bash
cd /home/eagle/vpp/build-root/build-vpp-native/external/src-dpdk
rm -rf build
meson setup build
cd build
meson configure -Dexamples=helloworld
ninja

Result: The build process created the dpdk-helloworld executable in build/examples/.
3. Running the helloworld Example

The helloworld example was executed on CPU cores 0-3 to verify the DPDK installation.

Command:
bash
sudo ./build/examples/dpdk-helloworld -l 0-3 -n 4

Result: The example ran successfully, printing "hello" from each core (0 to 3), confirming that DPDK was correctly configured and operational.

Challenges and Solutions

Several challenges were encountered during the setup and execution process:

    Outdated Meson Version:
        Issue: The initial Meson version (0.53.2) was incompatible with DPDK, which required version 0.57 or higher.
        Solution: Upgraded Meson to version 1.8.0 using:
        bash

    pip3 install --user meson --upgrade
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    Outcome: The upgraded Meson resolved compatibility issues, allowing the build to proceed.

Missing helloworld Executable:

    Issue: After running ninja, the dpdk-helloworld executable was not found in build/examples/.
    Solution: Rebuilt the project from scratch by removing the build directory and re-running the build commands:
    bash

        cd /home/eagle/vpp/build-root/build-vpp-native/external/src-dpdk
        rm -rf build
        meson setup build
        cd build
        meson configure -Dexamples=helloworld
        ninja
        Outcome: The rebuild ensured that the dpdk-helloworld executable was correctly generated.
    PATH Configuration for Meson:
        Issue: The upgraded Meson was installed in /home/eagle/.local/bin, which was not in the systemâ€™s PATH.
        Solution: Added the directory to PATH using the commands above.
        Outcome: The system used the correct Meson version (1.8.0) for the build.

Conclusion

This project successfully configured HugePages and ran the DPDK helloworld example on CPU cores 0-3. The challenges related to Meson versioning and build issues were resolved through careful debugging and rebuilding. The results confirm that the DPDK environment is correctly set up.
